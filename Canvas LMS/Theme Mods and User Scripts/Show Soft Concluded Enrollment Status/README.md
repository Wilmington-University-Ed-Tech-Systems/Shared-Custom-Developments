# Show Soft Concluded Enrollment Status

This feature applies to the People page within a course. It will check each user to see if they have an active enrollment that is in a soft-concluded state based on enrollment dates (term, course, section, and/or user enrollment dates). Users that are soft-concluded don't have access to participate in the course, so this helps to make it clear if their access has ended even though their enrollment is active.
